# Hotel Booking Analysis

This project involves analyzing hotel booking data to extract meaningful insights and predict booking cancellations. The dataset includes information on bookings for city and resort hotels, such as booking dates, length of stay, number of guests, and more.

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hotel booking data to uncover trends and patterns. Additionally, we aim to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of booking cancellations. This analysis can help hotel management in decision-making processes, such as optimizing booking strategies and improving customer satisfaction.

## Installation

To run the analysis, ensure you have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NASO7Y/hotel-booking-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd hotel-booking-analysis
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `project.ipynb` to explore the data analysis and model building steps.

## Analysis and Results

In this project, we performed the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized data distributions and relationships to uncover insights such as booking trends, cancellation rates, and customer demographics.

3. **Feature Selection**: Identified important features influencing booking cancellations using statistical methods.

4. **Model Building**: Developed a predictive model using Logistic Regression to predict the likelihood of booking cancellations.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and classification report.

Key findings from the analysis include:

- City hotels have a higher cancellation rate compared to resort hotels.
- Longer lead times are associated with higher cancellation probabilities.
- Repeat guests are less likely to cancel their bookings.

For detailed analysis and visualizations, refer to the `project.ipynb` notebook.
